# Functional C

## Code to accompany Hartel's "Functional C."

### Functional C? Wait, what? C language is the world's most famous imperative language. Okay fine, most famous after Java. Yes, sure; after Java and Python. But functional programming in a language like C, I mean, that's impossible, right? Well to quote 90's soul group En Vogue, "Free your mind and the rest will follow." Indeed it is possible to do functional programming in C. Not to the degree that one can in say, Haskell, but it is possible to bring a substantial functional flavor to your C programming and Mr. Hartel's book shows precisely how to do that.
